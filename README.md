# 🌱 AI Data Cleaning Agent

Modern data centers store massive volumes of duplicated, obsolete, or low-value data. This uncontrolled growth increases storage requirements, energy consumption, and CO₂ emissions, negatively impacting both infrastructure performance and environmental sustainability.

This project introduces an autonomous AI agent designed to intelligently analyze, clean, and optimize data. By identifying redundant and unnecessary information, the agent helps reduce storage overhead, improve system efficiency, and minimize the environmental footprint of data infrastructures.

# Key goals:

[Detect duplicated and low-value data](#Detection)

[Automate data cleaning and optimization](#Cleaning&Optimization)

[Reduce storage and energy consumption](#Consumption)

[Improve overall infrastructure performance](#Performance)

[Promote sustainable and eco-friendly data management](#Nature)
